This is a placeholder for where the LITL Fiber implementation will eventually live.

It is planned to be integrated in the LITL Engine ECS library, but is on hold until the basic functionality is fully up and running. Although Fibers offer great upsides to ECS, they are not trivial to implement and it makes sense to first have a working library and then add them into it.

A good primer on Fibers can be found here:
